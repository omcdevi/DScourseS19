    \item class(df1) is data.frame and class(df) is SparkDataFrame
    \item it is not able to find "inherited method" in order to operate on df1 because it is not a data frame compatible with Spark
    \item again it does not work because its not formatted for Spark
\end{enumerate}

\section{Problem 7}
    I would definitely be interested in scraping from sports databases, especially historical daily individual NBA statistics (i.e. box scores). I would also be interested in financial data but OU has access to WRDS, so I feel like anything I would scrape would pale in comparison to that database.
