\begin{itemize}
    \item Measurement: gaining insight into qualitative phenomena through data
    \item Statistical Programming Languages: using code to run statistical analysis on a computer (Scripted languages are more user friendly, while compiled languages deal directly with the CPU and thus are faster and more powerful)
    \item Web Scraping: downloading data from publically available places on the internet
    \item Handling Large Datasets: using RDDs and Spark or Hadoop to make large datasets more managebale while preventing any loss of data due to a computer failing 
    \item Visualization: creating visualizations of the data using a graphics package to see what the data looks like (distribution, trends, correlations, outliers, etc.)
    \item Modeling: using statistics to test, predict, or explain phenomena or theory
\end{itemize}
