\section{Summary of Interests}

I am mostly interested in econometrics. Before I started the BA/MA econ program I earned my BS in math, and I really loved it. However, as far as research was concerned, I realized I was far more interested in statistical theory than any other branches of pure mathematics. Also, I think econometrics is particularly cool because it kind of bridges the gap between all of these abstract understandings of the world and what is actually happening in reality. I decided to take this course, because I think that "big data" methods are becoming increasingly useful in achieving this goal. There is so much data being collected by technology, and these methods can help translate the seemingly endless stream of information into convincing empirical evidence. I also want to get better with R and programming in general. I think this course will help. I am not sure what I want to do exactly for my project yet, but I was thinking of doing some sort of predictive model for sports betting on Draft Kings if that is okay. Learning to web scrape will really help me collect data for that. After graduation, I plan on pursuing a PhD in Economics. I applied in the fall, so I am just waiting to hear back.
